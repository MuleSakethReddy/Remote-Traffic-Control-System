# Remote-Traffic-Control-System
Manual control of the traffic is very tiresome and requires a lot of traffic police at every signal to control the traffic. Also traffic might not be same
in all the lanes. Some lanes might have heavy traffic and others might be empty. The current system does not consider this which leads to traffic jams.
To solve this I developed remote traffic control system. This will enable the traffic police to control the signal from their command center and decrease 
congestion by changing the signals based on traffic density in a lane.

I have also come up with a model which will automatically decide the signal to be shown for each lane based on the traffic density detected by sensors on all lanes

REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION:
